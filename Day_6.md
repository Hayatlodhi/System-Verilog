In SystemVerilog, a fork is a language construct used for creating parallel or concurrent execution of statements. A fork-join block is used to create a parallel block of code execution, where the code inside the fork block is executed concurrently with the code outside of the fork block.<br /> Today I learned forks in system verilog and at the end I implemented the class exercise where we can use all three ways which are jin, join_none and join_any.
